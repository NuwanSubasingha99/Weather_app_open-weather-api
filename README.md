## Weather App



**Project Description:**

This project is a JavaScript-based weather application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for a specified location. Users can enter a city name to retrieve detailed weather information, presented in a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

**Key Concepts:**

* **HTML:** Provides the fundamental structure of the web page, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, input fields, and buttons.
* **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements, controlling their appearance (colors, fonts, layout) to create an attractive and well-organized user interface.
* **JavaScript:** The dynamic layer of the application, responsible for user interactions, API calls, and data manipulation. It retrieves weather data, processes it, and populates the HTML elements with the retrieved information.
* **OpenWeatherMap API:** An external API (Application Programming Interface) that grants access to comprehensive weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, and more. It requires an API key (not included in this repository) to function.
* **Fetch API:** A modern JavaScript API used for making asynchronous (non-blocking) HTTP requests to fetch data from web servers, including retrieving weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data format commonly used for data exchange between web applications and APIs. Weather data returned by the OpenWeatherMap API is typically in JSON format, which JavaScript can easily parse and utilize.
* **User Interaction:** The application provides an input field where users can enter a city name. This triggers a JavaScript function that handles the user input, constructs the API request URL, and fetches weather data.


**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Create a free OpenWeatherMap API key:**

   - Sign up for an account at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).
   - Navigate to your profile and create an API key.
   - **Important:** **Do not store or share your API key publicly in your code.**

3. **Install dependencies (optional):**

   If you prefer using a bundler like Webpack or Parcel, install the necessary dependencies according to their documentation.

4. **Update API key:**

   - Open the `index.html` file and locate the placeholder for the API key in the JavaScript code.
   - Replace it with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

5. **Run the application:**

   - Open `index.html` in your web browser or use a local development server like Live Server or `python -m http.server`.
